# 🧑‍💻 Priyanshu’s DSA Playground    
**Welcome, brave soul. You’ve stumbled into my personal stash of DSA codes — a place where sorting, searching, and other algorithmic nightmares are tamed (well… kind of).**

   **>> Where Algorithms come to suffer <<**

## ⚔️ What’s inside?  
1. 🔍 Searching Algorithms – Because finding x in an array shouldn’t feel like finding your socks after laundry.  
2. 🔄 Sorting Algorithms – From 🫧 Bubble Sort (aka “grandma’s algorithm”) to ⚡ QuickSort (the caffeine-chugging overachiever).    
3. 📑 Notes & Cheatsheets – Quick lookups for when my brain.exe stops responding.  
<br> 

## 🤓 Who’s this for?  
1. 👨‍💻 Me – because future-me forgets faster than RAM without backup.  
2. 🫵 You – if StackOverflow’s sarcasm isn’t enough motivation.  
3. 😎 Anyone – who dares to read C++ without crying.  

<br>

## ⚡ How to use  
1. Clone, copy, steal, fork — whatever makes your repo count look cooler.  
2. Just remember: all codes are in C++. So if you’re a Python fan, may the indentation gods save you.
3. Pray it compiles. 🙏  

<br>
 
## 🚀 Why this repo exists?  
1. Because every time I revise algorithms, I forget half of them the next morning.  
2. So this is my personal diary — but instead of feelings, it’s full of for loops and recursion that may or may not segfault.

|⭐ Pro tip: If this repo saves your life before an exam, at least star it. If it doesn’t, blame C++ and move on. |
